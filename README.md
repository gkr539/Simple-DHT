# Simple-DHT
A distributed hash table (DHT) is a decentralized storage system that provides lookup and storage schemes similar to a hash table, storing key-value pairs. Each node in a DHT is responsible for keys along with the mapped values. Any node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.
